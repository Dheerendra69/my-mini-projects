Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, it enables fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it ideal for real-time applications such as chat servers, APIs, and data streaming services. Its package manager, npm, provides access to thousands of reusable modules, simplifying development. With Node.js, developers can use a single programming language—JavaScript—for both frontend and backend, enhancing productivity. Its lightweight and efficient nature has made it a popular choice for building modern web applications and microservices.
